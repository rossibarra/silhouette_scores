	abstract = {The study of maize domestication has overlooked the genetic structure within maize{\textquoteright}s wild relative teosinte. Prior to investigating the domestication history of maize (Zea mays subspecies mays), one should first understand the population history of teosintes and how they relate to maize. To achieve this, we used 32,739 SNPs obtained from a broad sampling of teosinte populations and 46 maize landraces and a) inferred current and past gene flow among teosinte populations and maize, b) analyzed the degree of introgression among Zea mays subspecies, and c) explored the putative domestication location of maize. We found geographic structure and introgression between Zea mays taxa. Teosinte subspecies have diverged significantly from maize, which indicates that current teosinte populations have evolved mainly independently from maize since the domestication. Our results further suggest that the likely ancestor of maize may be an extinct population of teosinte from Jalisco or the Pacific coast.},
